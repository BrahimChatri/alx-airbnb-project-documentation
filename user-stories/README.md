# User Stories for Airbnb Clone Project

## Overview
This directory contains user stories derived from the use case diagram created for the Airbnb Clone project. These user stories translate technical requirements into human-centered narratives that describe how different users will interact with the system.

## What are User Stories?
User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the person who wants the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system. They typically follow a simple template:

```
As a [type of user], I want to [perform some action] so that [achieve some goal/benefit].
```

## Purpose of User Stories
- Facilitate communication between stakeholders, developers, and users
- Keep the focus on user value and needs
- Break down complex requirements into manageable, implementable pieces
- Provide a basis for testing and validation

## Contents
The `user-stories.md` file contains comprehensive user stories organized by user type (Guest, Host, Admin) and categorized by functionality (Registration, Authentication, Property Management, etc.).

## Core User Stories

## Relationship to Use Case Diagram

While the use case diagram provides a technical overview of system functionality, these user stories add the human perspective on why those functionalities matter.
